# Data-Analyst-project-Case-Study-1---Danny-s-Diner
This is the whole case study of Danny's Dinner project using power-bi Report  

I am more focused toward visualizing data in "Danny’s Diner" Data Analyst project:

1. Identify Key Metrics and Questions

Metrics: Total sales, average spend per customer, most popular items.
Questions: Which customers are most loyal? What items generate the most revenue? What days have the highest sales?

3. Prepare the Data
Clean the Data: Remove any irrelevant data, handle missing values, and ensure consistency.
Aggregate Data: Group by customer, item, and date to create summary statistics like total sales per customer or per item.
4. Choose Visualizations Based on Insights Needed
Sales Trends: Use a line chart to show daily or monthly sales trends.
Top Customers: Use a bar chart to rank customers by total spend.
Popular Items: Use a pie chart or bar chart to visualize the proportion of sales by item.
Customer Behavior: Use a heatmap to identify peak visit times or sales periods.
5. Create Visualizations
Tool Selection: Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Excel.
Design: Focus on clarity—ensure charts have proper labels, legends, and a consistent color scheme to highlight key insights.
6. Analyze and Present
Insights: Draw conclusions from the visualizations, such as identifying high-value customers or popular items.
Presentation: Compile the visuals into a dashboard or report that tells a clear story about the diner’s performance.
